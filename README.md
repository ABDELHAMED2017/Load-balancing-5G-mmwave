This repository contains the Matlab scripts related to the paper [1]. 
The code generates a two tier HetNet with correlated blocking, according to the system model described in [1, Section-II] and computes association probability according to [1,Definition 1]. 
This code is used to estimate the blockage constant of the exponential blockage model, according to [1, Remark 3].  

### Instructions 
Run the script "simulation_sinr_germ_grain.m"
The parameter values are set in the script "parameters.m:
